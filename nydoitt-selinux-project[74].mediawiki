= Red Hat Subscriptions Overview =

Three factors play an important part in selecting the right RHEL subscription:

* The (Service Level Agreement) SLA
* The number of (physical) Sockets and,
* The number of Virtual Machines.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux can have layered products, like clustering. These require a separate subscription.

== Service Level Agreement ==

An important part of a subscription is access to Red Hat support. The SLA associated with a subscription plays an important part for the customer here as this defines response times.

[[File:images/subscriptions/sla_response_time.png|thumb|none|alt=Service level agreement response times|Service level agreement response times]]

== Socket Pairs ==

A conventional RHEL subscription is based upon socket-pairs. A socket meant here is the ''physical'' CPU socket.

Any subset of one or two sockets counts for one pair, so a node with 16 cores and two sockets requires one subscription to be compliant. A node with four sockets requires two single socket-pair subscriptions to be compliant.

A node with one socket will then require one subscription to be compliant, and a node with three sockets will require two subscriptions.

Of course, exceptions rule, so a node with four physical sockets of which only two have a seated CPU, will require just one subscription to be compliant.

== Virtualization ==

A conventional RHEL subscription can alternatively be used to subscribe RHEL virtual machines. The number of Virtual machines included with a subscription is two.

One subscription which would apply to a ''physical'' dual socket machine can also be used for two Virtual Machines. The number of virtual sockets or vCPUs assigned to the two Virtual Machines being subscribed by a conventional RHEL subscription are not relevant.

=== Virtual Datacenter Subscriptions ===

Virtual Datacenter (VDC) Subscriptions differ from conventional RHEL subscriptions in that they subscribe VMs per hypervisor rather than individually.

VDC subscriptions use a parent-child relationship to validate a VM’s subscription: the parent (the hypervisor) consumes a subscription while the children (the VMs running on that particular hypervisor) &quot;piggy back&quot; on that subscription. Any supported RHEL VMs running on a hypervisor with a valid VDC subscription have a valid subscription.

Similar to conventional subscriptions, VDC subscriptions are applied to hypervisors per socket-pair. See [[#_socket_pairs|Socket Pairs]].

<div class="note">

A VDC subscription is only valid for the virtual machines running on a hypervisor, not for the hypervisor itself (the hypervisor must have a separate subscription for its own operating system).


</div>
== Layered products ==

Layered products require the same SLA and number of socket-pairs as the RHEL OS these products are deployed upon.

== Red Hat Enterprise Linux life cycle ==

[[File:images/subscriptions/lifecycle_phases.png|thumb|none|alt=life cycle phases|life cycle phases]]

The Life-cycle has different phases with different types of support. Depending on the applications, the deployment of nodes could be aligned with the different phases; deploy in Full Support, maintain in Maintenance Support 1 and replace in Maintenance Support 2 would be an ideal model.

[[File:images/subscriptions/lifecycle_dates.png|thumb|none|alt=Life-cycle dates|Life-cycle dates]]

== Red Hat Support severity level definitions ==

https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/severity/

Opening a support case online can make it easier to share technical data, error messages, and system information with your Red Hat Support representative. Following the online submission with a phone call can reduce response time as well as potential errors in the capture of information.

Red Hat recommends that you follow any Severity 1 and 2 online support case submissions with a phone call to your local support center.

Red Hat Global Support Services uses the following definitions to classify issues:

=== Severity 1 (urgent) ===

A problem that severely impacts your use of the software in a production environment (such as loss of production data or in which your production systems are not functioning). The situation halts your business operations and no procedural workaround exists.

=== Severity 2 (high) ===

A problem where the software is functioning but your use in a production environment is severely reduced. The situation is causing a high impact to portions of your business operations and no procedural workaround exists.

=== Severity 3 (medium) ===

A problem that involves partial, non-critical loss of use of the software in a production environment or development environment. For production environments, there is a medium-to-low impact on your business, but your business continues to function, including by using a procedural workaround. For development environments, where the situation is causing your project to no longer continue or migrate into production.

=== Severity 4 (low) ===

A general usage question, reporting of a documentation error, or recommendation for a future product enhancement or modification. For production environments, there is low-to-no impact on your business or the performance or functionality of your system. For development environments, there is a medium-to-low impact on your business, but your business continues to function, including by using a procedural workaround.

== Tips to create a good support case ==

# Fill out the account number, your name, it is recommended to be individual instead global account.
# Select the product that it is affected.
# Version of the product.
# Problem statement should be precise to see if they are any KCS that help you on the resolution. Please read the KCS suggested before open a case. Remember use the name of the component that you are having issue – Ceph …. , Nova …. Keywords are very important.
# Explain your issue with the maximum details and add the commands that you are using with outputs.
# Problem statement should be descriptive like: [Component][Region] Issue description.<br />
Examples would be:<br />
''[Nova][NL Region] Nova fails on one compute''<br />
''[Ceph][Singapore Region] Ceph without OSD''
# Explain your issue with the maximum details and add the commands that you are using with outputs.

[[File:images/support/portal-ss.png|thumb|none|alt=Portal: case|Portal: case]]

# It is important to put the environment that it is affected, pre production, production and what region is affecting, London, New York<br />
Remember the severity levels and assign it properly.
# Do attach sosreports of the servers/components affect for speedup the case: https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3592
# Select server of support, add premium any time that you have the option.

[[File:images/support/portal-ss-2.png|thumb|none|alt=Portal: case details|Portal: case details]]

# Select severity level.
# Add into notification to someone or distribution list.
# If available, select a case group to notify other member, per example Cloud, alert all member of Cloud from your team and they could work on the case too.
